# filesystems and IoPFS the Internet of Presence Filesystem/ContentSystem
A Collection of usefull Filesystems and Conditions to use them as also abstraction layers over them.

The Intro text and discription is maybe missleading as it is more like IPFS InterPlanetary FileSystem but with some extra complexity performance and other features added.

The Main Concept is relativ simple there are Storage Devices and there are FileSystems to Configure how the data is stored and Read on that Devices.
Then there are so called Index Formarts and Meta Data to identify where the content is located.
In our Internet Of Presence World that would not work out of the box as we have many moving parts.

## Fun Facts to think about
- We have more Chaos and Chaos Engineering then Microsoft, Google or Amazon would ever need because we never know when a Node or lets say Server comes online
- We are never clear about the needed load for the content or the aviability of the content at a diffrent time.
- We can not Censor Content and maybe will never be able to do so without World Wide Physical Force.
- We are maybe able to get a world wide Google Like Search Engine for free with our IoPFS design
- There is no real diffrence between a Content Management System and a Filesystem so we call this often IoPCS and or IoPFS both terms discribe the same thing
